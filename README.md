# restaurantCompete

Build a restaurant compete system with clear MVC PHP code

**Architected so that it uses:**

1. Model, View, Controller
2. A Front Controller which implements a finite state machine.
   All requests go through _index.php_

**This combination allows:**

1. Separation of concerns (M/V/C)
2. The application can move from any page to any other page
3. Easy to extend and expand code
4. Self documenting code. Nothing is hidden more than a file away.
